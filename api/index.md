# Flax API

That section of documentation contains pages with information about the Flax scripting API, grouped by namespace.

To use this section, you should be familiar with C# scripting.
We also recommend using Visual Studio 2015.

For information about scripting, see the [Scripting](/manual/scripting/index.html) pages in the manual.
