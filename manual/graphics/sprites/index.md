# Sprites

**Sprites** are assets that contain an image comprised of pixel data. They are mainly used for GUI implementation and can be animated. A sprite can be a singular image or an image composed of multiple frames. When a sprite contains multiple images or frames it is known as a sprite atlas.

Flax Engine supports importing the following list of file types as sprites:
- `.png`
- `.jpg`
- `.jpeg`
- `.bmp`
- `.gif`
- `.tga`
- `.tif`
- `.tiff`
- `.dds`
- `.hdr`
- `.raw`

## Importing a sprite

The easiest way to import one or more sprites is to drag them from *Explorer* to the *Content* window.
