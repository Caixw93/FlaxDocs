Flax offers a wide variety of graphics pipeline features as well as solid renderer that includes deferred shading, global illumination, reflective environment and post-processing.

This section explains all you need to know about working with materials pipeline, importing textures, lighting the environment and much more.

## Supported graphics backends

* DirectX 11 (with DirectX 10/10.1 fallback)
* DirectX 12
* Vulkan

> [!TIP]
> To check on which rendering backend game is running use [GraphicsDevice.RendererType](https://docs.flaxengine.com/api/FlaxEngine.Rendering.GraphicsDevice.html#FlaxEngine_Rendering_GraphicsDevice_RendererType). You can also use [GraphicsDevice.ShaderProfile](https://docs.flaxengine.com/api/FlaxEngine.Rendering.GraphicsDevice.html#FlaxEngine_Rendering_GraphicsDevice_ShaderProfile) to check the shaders format that is being used by the rendering backend.
