We always welcome collaborative participation and community development.
We believe that open source projects have huge potential and provide many opportunities to develop better software.
With that in mind, we open-source many components of the Flax Engine. This includes editor, C# scripting API, and even this documentation.

Check out the official open-source repositories on a Github:

* [https://github.com/FlaxEngine](https://github.com/FlaxEngine)

## Open Source Editor and API

The main open-source repository [FlaxAPI](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxAPI) contains full source code of the Flax Editor and C# scripting API. You can fork it and edit whatever you need. Modified API and Editor can be used in Flax games production so it can be very handy to have more control over the engine. Also, any pull requests are welcome.

If you want to open the FlaxAPI in Visual Studio you need to install [Flax Engine Tools for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Flax.FlaxVS) extension.

See [Open Source API](open-source-api.md) documentation page to learn more about FlaxAPI.
