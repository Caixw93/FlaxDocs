# Let's make game engines great again!

We always welcome collaborative participation and community development.
We believe that open source projects have huge potential and provide many opportunities to develop better software.
With that in mind, we open-source many components of the Flax Engine. This includes editor, C# scripting API, and even this documentation.

Check out the official repositories on a Github:

The main open-source repository [Flax Engine](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxEngine) contains full source code of the Flax Engine and Flax Editor with all tools and platforms. You can fork it and edit whatever you need. Modified Engine or/and Editor can be used in Flax games production so it can be very handy to have more control over the engine. Also, any pull requests are welcome.

If you want to open the Flax Engine in Visual Studio you might need to install [Flax Engine Tools for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Flax.FlaxVS) extension.
