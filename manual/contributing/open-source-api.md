The main open-source repository [FlaxAPI](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxAPI) contains full source code of the Flax Editor and C# scripting API. You can fork it and edit whatever you need. Modified API and Editor can be used in Flax games production so it can be very handy to have mor control over the engine. Also any pull requests are welcome.
