The next step is to **log in** to the Flax Launcher. Simply use the same account credential you used to access the installer. Your account is required to verify if you can download the engine builds from our digital distribution. Launcher supports *Offline mode* in case you want to create games without Internet access, far from civilization (far in the forest or on the sea).

After you log in go to the **Engine** page. It is used to download and managed engine installations. You can have multiple different versions on Flax installed on your computer. Here you can add new updates and download additional packages. To install Flax use **Add Version** button. Then select the version and a target installation destination folder. You can also pick a target platform to install. Those packages are required if you want to build and deploy your game for a given platform. Finally, you can press **Install** button and wait for just a second to download Flax binaries.

> [!Note]
> The engine version with a blue outline is marked as default to open projects. Use the context menu on it (3 dots) to set another version as default or to modify its properties.
