# Create new project

![Flax Projects Page](media/projects-page.jpg)

After you [get Flax](get-flax.md) navigate to the **Projects** page in Flax Launcher. Here you can view your projects library. You can open existing projects by double clicking on them (the default engine version). Also, you can use the context menu (3 dots near its name label) to delete, unlink or view project location.

If it's your first time with Flax we recommend you using **Get Flax Samples** that will download a collection of free projects that showcase various engine features and can be used as a base for your journey with Flax. Flax Samples are free and open-source [available here](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxSamples).

You can also add an existing project from your drive using **Add Project** button. Simply pick the folder that contains a project and it will appear in your project's library.

To create a new project use **New Project** button in the upper right corner of the page and follow the dialog instructions. You can pick a template, specify the project name and the target location. After that click **Create Project** button and open it, via double click in projects library.
