# World Units

![World Grid](media/world-grid.png)

Flax uses **centimeters** as a unit of length and **kilograms** as a unit of weight.
These world units are used by the physics and rendering engines.
You should stick to using realistic values in order to create solid visual and physical behaviour of the objects.
